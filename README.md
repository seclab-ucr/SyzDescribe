# SyzDescribe

## Next
1. Because the bitcodes generated from the Linux v6.1 are different from the Linux v5.12.
There will be some additional changes coming for the Linux v6.1.
2. A more powerful and general SyzDescribe based on under constrained symbolic execution.
3. To support net device drivers.

```

## Build
Requirements: Ubuntu 22.04
```shell
sudo apt install -y git llvm cmake
git clone https://github.com/seclab-ucr/SyzDescribe.git
cd SyzDescribe
bash ./script/build.bash
```

Note: The version of LLVM/Clang is 14.

## Run
```shell
build/tools/SyzDescribe/SyzDescribe --config_json=config.json
```
> The config.json refers to `config/config.json `, for example:
```
{
  "bitcode": "built-in.bc", 
    // the path of the linked bitcode file of kernel modules
  "knowledge": "~/SyzDescribe/config/knowledge.json",
    // the path of the knowledge file
  "version": "v5.12"
    // the version of the kernel, used to generate debug info
}
```
The generated syscall descriptions are `syz_describe_*.txt`, which can directly used in syzkaller based on [doc](https://github.com/google/syzkaller/blob/master/docs/syscall_descriptions.md).

## Linked LLVM Bitcode for Linux Kernel: `built-in.bc`
refer to [https://github.com/ZHYfeng/Generate_Linux_Kernel_Bitcode/tree/master/v5.12](https://github.com/ZHYfeng/Generate_Linux_Kernel_Bitcode/tree/master/v5.12)
> use `-save-temps` and `-g` to generate LLVM bitcode with debug info and less optimization

**Please do not use a huge bitcode file, e.g., `drivers/built-in.bc`.**
**I would suggest to generate syscall descriptions for each `drivers/*/built-in.bc`.**


## Generated syscall descriptions

SyzDescribe/SyzDescribe_Syscall_Description for v5.12.

[SyzDescribe_Syscall_Description](https://github.com/ZHYfeng/SyzDescribe_Syscall_Description) for all.
